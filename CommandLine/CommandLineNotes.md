## <span style="color: red;">Overview</span>

*   Notes about improving my abilities in the command line and related tools. <span style="color: #FA8072;">(ZSH, Z)    </span>

*   The command line is great for everyone, web developers, designers or even those that just want to be more           comfortable with the computer.

## <span style="color: red;">Terminal Basics</span>

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">$</span> This is the first thing that you see it is called the prompt.

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(pwd)</span>   Present Working Directory will tell you what folder you are            currently in.

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(cd)</span> Change Directory will help you to move to the directory that you          want.  CD then the name of the directory.  It is case sensitive.

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(cd ..)</span> This will move you a directory up.

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(mkdir)</span> Make Directory will make a new directory in the folder that you        are currently in. mkdir followed by whatever you want to name the folder. 

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(Command k or Ctrl k)</span> This will clear the command screen if you want a         clean screen.

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(ls -l or ls)</span> List the Directory.  This will list all of the files that        are in the directory that you are currently using.  ls-l means long and gives more information. LS just list        the folders

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(touch)</span>  Touch will create a file.  For example touch index.html will          create an index html file in the folder that you are currently in. 

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(rm)</span> RM means to Remove a file. If you accidentally rm with a * or rm with     a ~ you can remove your entire hard drive.  rm also is final so you cant get anything back. There is another        way to delete that puts the item into your trash instead of deleting it forever. 

## <span style="color: red;">Cygwin or iTerm</span>

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">iTerm</span> is another app that is very helpful for having a lot of options in       the terminal.  It is for mac users.

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">Cygwin</span> is what windows users will use.  Listen to the tutorials on YouTube     on how to get Cygwin set up. Once downloaded you want to open the preferences and make changes that would most      suit you as a user. You can change the keys to make your own shortcuts etc...

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">Cygwin / Linux </span> Another thing to note about cygwin is that it allows you       to use linux commands on Windows. Learning linux commands is very important and can be extremely helpful.
