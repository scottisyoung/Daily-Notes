## <span style="color: red;">Overview</span>

*   Notes about improving my abilities with Git and related tools. <span style="color: #FA8072;">(GitHub)</span>

*   Git is a tool to save versions of your code. It is a __version control tool__ that developers use to save all       relavant versions of thier work and avoid losing all progress in their work. It also makes it easy for              developers to collaborate and share work with others. 

*   It works by reccording changes you make to a project, storing those hanges, then allowing you to referenccec        them as needed. 

## <span style="color: red;">Git Essentials</span>

*  <span style="color: #FA8072;">(Git Init)</span> The word Init means Initialize.  The command sets up all the         tools that Git needs to begin tracking changes that are made to a project.  When you type the command __git         init__ you will see that it will initialize an empty repository for you. 

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(Git Workflow)</span> A normal project will consist usually of having 3 parts.        After editing files in the working directory, they will be added to a staging area, then they will saved to a       Git repository.

    1.  <span style="color: #FA8072;">__A Working Directory__</span> This is where you will be doing all the work: 
         __creating, editing, deleting, and organizing files__.
    2.  <span style="color: #FA8072;">__A Staging Area__</span> This is where you will list all of the changes you      make in the working directory.
    3.  <span style="color: #FA8072;">__A Repository__</span> This is where Git permanently stores all the changes      as different __versions__ of the project.

*   <span style="color: #FA8072;">(Git Status)</span> This is a way that we can see the changes made to the working     directory. _Untracked Files_ are those that Git sees but has not started tracking changes yet. These files will     be in <span style="color: red;">_RED_</span>.
